## Dashboard

The dashboard provides an overview of your network security status:

- **Device Count:** Total devices discovered on your network
- **Active Alerts:** Alerts requiring attention
- **Events Today:** Total events processed in the last 24 hours
- **Anomalies:** Detected behavioral anomalies

Click any stat card to navigate to the detailed view.

## Devices

### Device List

The Devices page shows all discovered network devices with:
- Hostname and IP address
- MAC address
- Device status (online, offline, quarantined)
- First and last seen timestamps

### Device Details

Click a device to view:
- **Overview:** Basic device information
- **Events:** Recent events from this device

**Release a Device:**
1. Open quarantined device
2. Click "Release" button
3. Confirm the action

## Events

### Event Feed

View all normalized events from configured log sources:
- Filter by event type (DNS, firewall, auth, http, system)
- Filter by severity (debug, info, warning, error, critical)
- Filter by time range
- Search by IP, domain, or message content

### Event Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| DNS | DNS queries and responses |
| Firewall | Firewall allow/block actions |
| Auth | Authentication events |
| HTTP | Web request logs |
| System | System and application logs |
| LLM | AI/LLM interaction events |
| Endpoint | Endpoint agent events (processes, connections) |
| Flow | Network flow data (NetFlow/sFlow) |

## Alerts

### Alert Management

Alerts are generated by:
- Anomaly detection system
- Detection rules
- Playbook triggers
- Manual creation

**Alert Severities:**
- **Info:** Informational, no action required
- **Low:** Minor issue, investigate when convenient
- **Medium:** Moderate concern, investigate soon
- **High:** Significant threat, investigate immediately
- **Critical:** Severe threat, immediate action required

### Alert Actions

**Acknowledge Alert:**
1. Open alert details
2. Click "Acknowledge"
3. Add notes (optional)

**Analyze with AI:**
1. Open alert details
2. Click "Analyze"
3. View AI-generated analysis including:
   - Severity assessment
   - Potential threat indicators
   - Recommended actions

## Anomaly Detection

### How It Works

NetGuardian learns normal behavior patterns for each device:
- DNS query patterns (domains, volume, blocked ratio)
- Traffic patterns (connections, ports, data volume)
- Connection patterns (destinations, protocols)

Anomalies are detected when behavior deviates significantly from baselines.

### Anomaly Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| New Domain | Device queried a never-before-seen domain |
| Volume Spike | Unusual increase in DNS queries or traffic |
| Blocked Spike | Sudden increase in blocked requests |
| New Connection | Connection to new IP/port combination |
| Pattern Change | Significant change in behavior patterns |

### Managing Anomalies

**Review Anomaly:**
1. Open anomaly details
2. Review device context and baseline comparison
3. Determine if legitimate or suspicious

**Mark Anomaly Status:**
- **Acknowledged:** Under investigation
- **False Positive:** Not a real threat
- **Resolved:** Threat mitigated

### Recalculating Baselines

After resolving false positives or expected behavior changes:
1. Open device details
2. Go to Baselines tab
3. Click "Recalculate Baseline"

## AI Chat

### Natural Language Queries

Use the AI Chat to ask questions about your network:

**Example Queries:**
- "Show me devices with unusual DNS activity"
- "What alerts were generated today?"
- "Summarize network activity for the last hour"
- "Which device has the most blocked requests?"

### Model Selection

Choose the model based on your needs:
- **Fast (Haiku):** Quick responses for simple queries
- **Balanced (Sonnet):** Good balance of speed and depth
- **Deep (Sonnet):** Detailed analysis for complex questions

## Quarantine Management

### Quarantine Page

The Quarantine page shows:
- Currently quarantined devices
- Integration status (AdGuard, router)
- Recent quarantine/release activity

### Sync Quarantine

If integrations get out of sync:
1. Go to Quarantine page
2. Click "Sync Quarantine"
3. This reconciles device status with external systems

## Playbooks

### What Are Playbooks?

Playbooks are automated response rules that trigger actions based on events:

**Trigger Types:**
- Anomaly detected
- Alert created
- New device discovered
- Device status changed
- Manual trigger

**Action Types:**
- Quarantine device
- Release device
- Create alert
- Tag device
- Send notification (webhook)
- Log event

### Creating a Playbook

1. Go to Settings > Playbooks
2. Click "Create Playbook"
3. Configure:
   - Name and description
   - Trigger conditions
   - Actions to execute
   - Rate limits (cooldown, max executions/hour)
4. Save and activate

### Example Playbook

**Auto-quarantine high-risk anomalies:**
```
Trigger: Anomaly detected with severity >= high
Actions:
  1. Quarantine device
  2. Create alert with severity: critical
  3. Send webhook notification
Cooldown: 300 seconds
Max per hour: 10
```

## Log Sources

### Configuring Sources

Admin users can configure log sources:

1. Go to Settings > Log Sources
2. Click "Add Source"
3. Select source type:
   - **API Pull:** Fetch from REST APIs (AdGuard, UniFi, etc.)
   - **File Watch:** Monitor log files
   - **API Push:** Receive events via webhook
   - **UDP Listen:** Receive NetFlow/sFlow data

### API Pull Configuration

```
URL: http://adguard.local:3000
Endpoint: /control/querylog
Auth Type: Basic
Username: admin
Password: ******
Poll Interval: 5 seconds
```

### API Push Configuration

After creating an API Push source, use the generated API key:

```bash
curl -X POST http://netguardian:8000/api/v1/logs/ingest \
  -H "X-Source-API-Key: your-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"events": [{"raw_message": "event data"}]}'
```

### Endpoint Agent Sources

To receive data from endpoint agents:

1. Create an **API Push** source with **endpoint** parser
2. Copy the generated API key
3. Configure the endpoint agent with the API key
4. Agent sends process and network events automatically

### NetFlow/sFlow Sources

To receive network flow data:

1. Create a **UDP Listen** source
2. Select parser type: **netflow** or **sflow**
3. Configure the UDP port (default: 2055 for NetFlow, 6343 for sFlow)
4. Configure your router/switch to send flow data to NetGuardian
